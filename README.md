# Task-2-LGMVIP-Data-Science-Stock-Market-Prediction-And-Forecasting-Using-Stacked-LSTM-
Stock Market Prediction And Forecasting Using Stacked LSTM

In this project, we are going to use Kaggleâ€™s MasterCard stock dataset from May-25-2006 to Oct-11-2021 and train the LSTM models to forecast the stock price. This is a simple project-based tutorial where we will analyze data, preprocess the data to train it on advanced RNN models, and finally evaluate the results.

The project requires Pandas and Numpy for data manipulation, Matplotlib.pyplot for data visualization, scikit-learn for scaling and evaluation, and TensorFlow for modeling. We will also set seeds for reproducibility.
